## Description
The FjordVision project explores the impact of various alpha regularization parameters on the performance of hierarchical classification models using a self developed marine dataset and the COCO dataset. This project aims to determine how model configurations affect the recognition capabilities for categories such as marine species and vehicles in the COCO dataset.

## Usage

This section outlines the necessary steps to utilize the project for running our code with pre-trained models and experimental data.

### Download datasets and experimental data

Run the script

```bash
./setup-and-download.sh
```
This script will download the following:

- **Esefjorden Marine Vegetation Segmentation Dataset (EMVSD)**:
    - Contains 17,000 annotated images of marine vegetation and fauna collected from Esefjorden, Norway.
    - Annotations are provided in:
        - YOLO txt format for object detection.
        - COCO mask format for instance segmentation.

- **Pre-Trained Model Weights**:
    - Includes pre-trained weights for object detection models trained on the EMVSD dataset:
        - YOLOv8
        - YOLOv9
        - RT-DETR
        - MaskRCNN

- **Hierarchical Classification Datasets**:
    - Organized as a combination of:
        - Parquet files containing metadata for segmented objects, including:
            - `masked_image`: Path to the segmented image file.
            - `confidence`: Confidence score for the prediction.
            - `predicted_species`: Predicted species label.
            - `species`: True species label.
        - Folders of segmented images corresponding to the detected objects.

- **Trained Hierarchical Classification Models**:
    - Weights for hierarchical CNN models trained using EMVSD dataset outputs.
    - Includes alpha-regularized models for fine-tuned performance.

- **Segmented Object Outputs**:
    - Segmentation outputs from trained models, organized by model type:
        - **MaskRCNN**:
            - Segmented images: `maskrcnn-segmented-objects/`
            - Metadata: `maskrcnn-segmented-objects-dataset.parquet`

### Run our model on video

If you want to run inference with our models on a video stream use the following
command

```bash
python3 scripts/run_classification_stream.py --display_level="species" --output_path="demo/output-species.mp4"
```

Available hierarcical levels are "species", "genus", "class", "binary".

### Run experiments and gather F1 scores

This is done by running the notebook `run-experiments.ipyn`

### Visualise activations and class activiations

This is done by running the notebook `hierarcical-cnn-visualisation.ipyn`
